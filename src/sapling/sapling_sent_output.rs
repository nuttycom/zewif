/// Represents a sent output in a Sapling shielded transaction within a Zcash wallet.
///
/// `SaplingSentOutput` stores the plaintext details of a Sapling note that was sent by the
/// wallet, which are not recoverable from the blockchain after transmission. This information
/// enables selective disclosure, allowing a sender to prove they made a payment to a specific
/// shielded address without revealing additional transaction details.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In Zcash's Sapling protocol (activated in October 2018):
///
/// - **Shielded transactions** encrypt transaction details on the blockchain using zk-SNARKs
/// - **Notes** are the fundamental unit of value transfer, similar to UTXOs in transparent transactions
/// - **Sent output information** is stored by the sender's wallet to enable proofs of payment
///
/// Each sent output contains components of the Sapling note:
/// - Diversifier: Part of the recipient's shielded address derivation
/// - Public key: The recipient's public key for the transaction
/// - Value: The amount of ZEC transferred
/// - Rcm: Random commitment material used to construct the note commitment
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, sent output information must be preserved to maintain
/// the ability to generate payment proofs for regulatory compliance, auditing,
/// or other selective disclosure purposes. The sending wallet is the only entity
/// that has this information in plaintext form.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::{sapling::SaplingSentOutput, Blob, Amount};
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # fn example() -> Result<()> {
/// // Create a new sent output
/// let mut sent_output = SaplingSentOutput::new();
///
/// let value = Amount::from_u64(5000000)?; // 0.05 ZEC
/// sent_output.set_value(value);
///
/// // Access the components
/// let amount = sent_output.value();
/// let zats: i64 = amount.into();
/// assert_eq!(zats, 5000000);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
